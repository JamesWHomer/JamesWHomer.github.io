                    I studied in Sweden at The International Highschool (of the Gothenburg Region) under the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Although my chosen subjects were heavily focus on STEM, I maintained a wide interest in other fields, such as a History.

                <p>At age 13, self initiated learning led me to explore Java through Minecraft plugins, eventually mastering Java and expanding my repertoire into C++, Javascript and Python. I spent my next few years gradually improving my skills, as well as doing some freelance work on the side, learning how to deal effectively with clients and manage my time.</p>

                <p>At age 10, my already existing interest in all things computer led me to the education focused visual programming tool Scratch where I became addicted. This would set me on the path of programming, improving my logical reasoning and mathematical abilities.</p>

        <h2>Away from Keyboard</h2>
        <p>
            When not at my computer I spend my time on multiple different hobbies. For example I have played the piano for over 11 year and the trumpet for 9. I've played in several bands and orchestra's throughout my time as a musician, as well as joining several music camps. In addition to mental hobbies I believe it's important to maintain physical prowess, that's why in my recent years I've been practicing Judo. Through Judo I've improved my physical resiliance and gained the values of respect and perseverance, both on and off the mat.
