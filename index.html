            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                I have a strong passion for music, having played the piano for over 11 years and the trumpet for 9 years. I've played in multiple orchestras and bands and have even played with members of the Gothenburg Symphonic Orchestra.

            <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to my musical endeavors, I have also been practicing Judo for 4 years. 
                Judo has not only enhanced my physical capabilities but also instilled in me the values of respect, perseverance, and resilience. 
                The practice of Judo has been a transformative journey, helping me build character and strength both on and off the mat.
